Git branching guidelines:
=========================
###### Inspired by: http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/
---

## Features/Issues development
`devel/`  
is the prefix for feature development branches.  
Followed by an explicit name in lower case, dash-separated. Should start with issue-xxxx if linked to a specific referenced issue.  
Ex.:
```bash
git checkout -b devel/global-orders master
git checkout -b devel/issue-1234-fx-rejected master
```
These branches will usually derive from master, except an existing release branch needs a significant extra development (see below release branches):
```bash
git checkout -b devel/global-fx-new-flow release/v1.2.3-global
```

## Releases
`release/`  
is the prefix for release branches.

Followed by a version number following the semantic versioning form (http://semver.org/): vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH  
With: MAJOR:branking changes, MINOR:non-breaking new features, PATCH: transparent fixes

And optionally a dash-separated title.  
Release branches must always derive from master.  
Ex.:
```bash
git checkout -b release/v1.2.3-global master
```
Development/issues branches should be merged together into a release branch before integration/UAT tests.  
Small extra-work and hotfixes can be performed in the release branch, history rewrite/cleanup is recommended (`git rebase -i`).  
Merging feature branches into release branches should be performed with `--no-ff` option in order to always create a merge commit, which allows easily reverting if necessary, and makes merging history traceable.  
Ex.:
```bash
git checkout release/v1.2.3-global
git merge --no-ff devel/global-orders
```

## Integrated Testing
`testing/`  
is the prefix for integrated testing branches. 
Followed by an explicit name in lower case, dash-separated.  
Testing branches must always derive from master.  
Ex.: 
```bash
git checkout -b testing/global-with-fx-and-issue-1234 master
```
The purpose of such branch is to allow the testing of several unrelated developments in the same environment, in the case when they will not be released together in the same release branch.  
Fixes and enhancement should not be performed in the testing branch, but always into the corresponding devel branch, and then merged back into the testing branch for the integrated tests.  
Merging devel branches into a testing branch should be performed with --no-ff option in order to always create a merge commit, which allows easily reverting if necessary, and makes merging history traceable.  
Ex.:
```bash
git checkout release/global-with-fx-and-issue-1234
git merge --no-ff devel/issue-1234-fx-rejected
```

## Hotfixes
`hotfix/`
is the prefix for hotfix branches.
Followed by `issue-<nb>-title-or-appropriate-name`
Hotfix branches must derive from master. They are intended for small quick foxes of Production version.
Ex.
```bash
git checkout -b hotfix/issue-2345-convbond-imp-err master
```
Merging feature branches should be performed with `--no-ff` option in order to always create a merge commit, which allows easily reverting if necessary, and makes merging history traceable.
Ex.:
```bash
git checkout master
git merge --no-ff hotfix/issue-2345-convbond-imp-err
```
If a release branch is currently being tested/prepared, the hotfix must be merged into it as well:
```bash
git checkout release/v1.2.3-global
git merge --no-ff hotfix/issue-2345-convbond-imp-err
```
Once merged, devel and hotfix branches should be cleaned up in order to avoid infinite growing of the branch list (safe as -d prevents deleting non-merged branches):
```bash
git branch -d devel/global-orders
```
And the remote branch:
```bash
git push --delete origin devel/global-orders
```

## Production
`master`
is the current Production branch (protected: forced push is blocked by gitlab).
Once validated, a release branch should be merged into master just before to deploy in Production.
```bash
git checkout master
git merge --no-ff release/v1.2.3-global
```
Finally, that commit on master must be tagged with the version number, easy future reference to this historical version:
```bash
git tag -a v1.2.3-global
```
